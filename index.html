        <h2>Snake Game created using Python.</h2>
        
<xmp>
    This game is a snake game which is created using the pygame module in python.
    I have used many predefined function in pygame library to make this game possible. 
    I have also used mixer from pygame module to give the background sound to this game.
    
    The snake size increases when it comes in contact with the food.
